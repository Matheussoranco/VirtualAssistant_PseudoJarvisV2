# JarvisV2
Version 2 of PseudoJarvis AI Assistant in python. PseudoJarvis is an AI assistant that i was working on. It's called "pseudo" Jarvis because it's not even close to a complex AI as in the Iron man movies, but it's a reminder of our constant search for it. This is a open repo, but I am currently researching for more nuanced and complex ways to develop. In not published projects, i was able to implement Llama 70B LLM to it, creating his successor, Friday.
PseudoJarvis is now a learning Repo. Feel free to use or reach-me
